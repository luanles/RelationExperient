BioCreative V chemical-disease relation (CDR) corpus (in short,
BC5CDR corpus) (13, 14, 16, 34): It consists of 1,500 PubMed arti-
cles with 4,409 annotated chemicals, 5,818 diseases, and 3,116
chemical-disease interactions. The relation task data is publicly available through
BioCreative V at https://biocreative.bioinformatics.udel.edu/resources/corpora/biocreative-v-cdr-corpus/.

This script make BioCreative V Chemical Disease Relation (CDR) corpus into BERT input file format.

For example:

227508_1	alpha-methyldopa hypotensive	naloxone reverses the antihypertensive effect of clonidine .  in unanesthetized ,  spontaneously hypertensive rats the decrease in blood pressure and heart rate produced by intravenous clonidine ,  5 to 20 micrograms/kg ,  was inhibited or reversed by nalozone ,  0 . 2 to 2 mg/kg .  the hypotensive effect of 100 mg/kg alpha-methyldopa was also partially reversed by naloxone .  naloxone alone did not affect either blood pressure or heart rate .  in brain membranes from spontaneously hypertensive rats clonidine ,  10 ( -8 )  to 10 ( -5 )  m ,  did not influence stereoselective binding of [3h]-naloxone  ( 8 nm )  ,  and naloxone ,  10 ( -8 )  to 10 ( -4 )  m ,  did not influence clonidine-suppressible binding of [3h]-dihydroergocryptine  ( 1 nm )  .  these findings indicate that in spontaneously hypertensive rats the effects of central alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation involve activation of opiate receptors .  as naloxone and clonidine do not appear to interact with the same receptor site ,  the observed functional antagonism suggests the release of an endogenous opiate by clonidine or alpha-methyldopa and the possible role of the opiate in the central control of sympathetic tone .	1
